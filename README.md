# Question_Answer_Game
Answer user-defined questions for points

This is a simple game where the computer asks you questions and you tell it if you got it right or not. 
There are a number of categories with five questions of different point values (difficulty) for each category. 
The categories and questions change each round. There are two rounds.

The game begins by asking you how many players will play and the names of each player.
The first player will then select a category and point value from the board.
The question is displayed. The player who selected the question gets the first opportunity to answer it (verbally). 
If the player cannot answer the question in time, the next player gets a chance. When the players are ready to 
see the answer, the enter key is pressed and the answer is displayed. The players then determine if points are added
or subtracted from the player who answered the question.

If the player answered the question correctly, they get points added and get to select a new category.
If the player answered incorrectly, they get points deducted from their score and the last player to select a question
gets to select then next question.

When all the questions are asked, the next round begins with new categories and questions.

The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner. In the event of a tie, a tie-breaker question is asked.
